TODO for GUI 1.0:
	• CombosBox's should read from Database for default possibilities
	• Finish placing everything based on relative coordinates to allow for re-sizing.

GUI 2.0 ideas:
	• Click to remove course from already taken
	• verifyCourse should work by checking if the course is valid against some database. Consult YACS perhaps?
	• Enable hover over for 'tool tip' for course info
	• Enhance read in from file button:
		• Allow 'add'/'remove' contents of the file to the current classes taken list
