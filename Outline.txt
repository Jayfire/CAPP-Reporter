Made in vim, ASCII is displayed properly at least in vim.

TO BE CHANGED:
			How the algorithm will be run: ./<The Algorithm> <Path to Requirements directory> <Path to Concentrations directory> <Path to GUI_Input.txt>
			Algorithm input:
				Algorithm_Input.txt:
					A file generated by the GUI, formatted as described below. This file contains the list of courses the user already took.

				Requirements folder:
					Each file will have as its name: <Major 1>-<Major 2 or "None">
					Each file will have a list or courses written in it using the language described below

				Concentration folder:
					A broad container that holds any groups of classes we may need to pull from.
					A given file will have a list of classes and the user will need to have taken any of these classes.


			Algorithm output:
				Algorithm_Output.txt:
					A file generated by the Algorithm containing a list of courses that the user must still take using the language as described below. If the algorithm wants the GUI to display comments with with the output list of courses taken, comment on which ever line may be appended, as explained below

			The language the algorithm will read:
				This language is a simple language used to list files, and list the option to substitute those files.

				Classes are denoted as <Major>-<Course number>
				Every line in this file is added together to make a large condition statement.
				For example, the following denotes that each of these courses has/must be taken (depending on which file it is in)
					CSCI-1100
					CSCI-1200
					CSCI-2300
					CSCI-2500

				It is important to note that each file MUST end with a newline character. Furthermore, there is no white space anywhere else in the file.
				The operator || is used as a delimiter to specify that either of these courses must be taken.
				For example, to show that a student must take either CIVL-1000 or CIVL-1010, as well as CIVL-2000:
				CIVL-1000||CIVL-1010
				CIVL-2000

				This language also has a few keywords. The character + following denotes that any course of the same major but with a greater or equal number will be accepted.
				For example, the following says either CSCI-1100 must be taken, or a 2000 or higher level CS course must be taken
					CSCI-1100||CSCI-2000+

				The next keyword is @<A number>:<Which concentration>. Thus means that there must be <the number> courses in the concentration given. For example, the following says 3 courses are required in concentration A, and 4 in ANY concentration.
			  The @ symbol indicates to the algorithm that a group of classes can be considered for this requirement.
					@3:A
					@4:*

				Another example:
					@2:LITR

				The above line indicates that a student must take 2 classes that are located in
				LITR.txt, which is displayed here:
					LITR-2110
					LITR-2450
					LITR-2770
					LITR-4150
					LITR-4160

				The # symbol indicates that this class is not used to fill just one requirement.  For example,
				the classes that fulfill the Comm-Intensive requirement can also be used to fill the HASS options and the CS Options.

				Another symbol is !.  Much like in logic, this character indicates that the following
				class cannot be used to fulfill the requirement.  For example:
					CSCI-2000+||!CSCI-2300

				This file will call on MATH-None.txt and CSCI-None.txt to make sure each of their separate requirements are fulfilled,
				including free electives.

				The last keyword allowed is //. This is a comment indicator. Anything written after it up until the next new line will be ignored.
				Comments must be on their own line.
				For example, the following is valid:
					// This is all ok to type. Note however, there may be NO white space before the #. That is important to remember!
					CSCI-1000 // This is not ok to type

The GUI sketch, how it will hopefully look in the end (Note, Read f stands for read courses in from file:
