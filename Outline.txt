Made in vim, ascii is displayed properly in vim.

How the algorithm will be run: ./<The Algorithm> <Path to Requirements directory> <Path to Concentrations directory> <Path to GUI_Input.txt>

Algorithm input:
	Algorithm_Input.txt:
		A file genereated by the GUI, formated as described below. This file contains the list of courses the user already took.

	Requirements folder:
		Each file will have as its name: <Major 1>/<Major 2 or "None"> 	
		Each ifle will have a list or courses written in it using the language described below

	Concentration folder:
		Each file will have as its name: <The Major>
		Each file will have as its contents, multiple lines, each of which contains a comma delimiated list of courses which comprise a single concentration
			For example, the following represents courses in a single concentration of the major <the name of the file> : CSCI-A,CSCI-B,CSCI-C,CSCI-D
			Note, comma seperated, no spaces!

Algorith output:
	Algorithm_Output.txt:
		A file generated by the Algorithmm containing a list of courses that the user must still take using the language as described below. If the algorithm wants the GUI to display comments with with the output list of courses taken, comment on which ever line may be appended, as explained below

The language the algorithm will read:
	This language is a simple language used to list files, and list the option to substitute those files.

	Classes are denoted as <Major>-<Course number>
	Every line in this file is anded together to make a large condition statement.
	For example, the following denotes that each of these courses has/must be taken (depending on which file it is in)
		CSCI-1100
		CSCI-1200
		CSCI-2300
		CSCI-2500

	It is important to note that each file MUST end with a newline character. Furthermore, there is no whitespace anywhere else in the file.
	This lauguage allows for the logical operators || and &&. For example, the following says either CS-1100 or CSCI-4090 must be taken, but that CSCI-1300 must NOT be taken
		CSCI-1100||CSCI-4090

	Thie language also has a few keywords. The character + following denotes that any course of the same major but with a greater or equal number will be accepted.
	For example, the following says either CSCI-1100 must be taken, or a 2000 or higher level CS course must be taken
		CSCI-1100||CSCI-2000+

	Another keyword allowed is the character *. This means 'anything that is not nothing'. For example, if a file contained solely a * followed by a newline, then one free elective is required to graduate. For example, the following means any CSCI course
		CSCI-*

	The next keyword is <A number>:C:<Which concentration>. Thus means that there must be <the number> courses in the concentration given. The :C: may be followed by * if any concentration is allowed. For example, the following says 3 courses are required in concentration A, and 4 in ANY concentration.
		3:C:A
		4:C:*

	The last keyword allowed is //. This is a comment indicator. Anything written after it up until the next new line will be ignored.
	For example, the following is valid:
		CSCI-1100//This is all ok to type. Note however, there may be NO whitespace before the //. That is important to remember!


The GUI sketch, how it will hopefully look in the end (Note, Read f stands for read courses in from file:
